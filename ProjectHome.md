A niche modelling software package.

The intent of this package is to be scriptable, extensible and fast, allowing niche modelling algorithms to be written in a high-level language, while also being simple and strutured enough to make the back-end highly modifiable.

It uses the GDAL library to read and write georeferenced images.
